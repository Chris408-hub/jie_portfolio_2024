My professional journey began with a background in international education and interactive media design, and it’s been an incredible ride so far.<br>

These moments remind me of the importance of balance, creativity, and embracing the simple joys in life.<br>

        I’m excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in the ever-evolving world of web development. As I continue to learn and grow, I look forward to contributing my unique skills and experiences to create meaningful online experiences that bring people together.<br>
