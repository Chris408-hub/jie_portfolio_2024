            <h3>Project Overview:</h3><p>The Senior University Website is a platform designed to provide learning and recreational activities for elderly individuals. Catering to a diverse range of interests such as piano, dance, musical instruments, philosophy, computer courses, and various physical activities suitable for seniors.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Our Audience:</h3><p>Our initial step was to deeply understand our target audience - the elderly. As a staff member responsible for enrollment and personnel management, I have a deep understanding of our audience's unique needs and challenges. Through direct engagement and research, we identified several key pain points:<br>
            <span class="bold">Complex Navigation:</span><br>
            <span class="bold">Small Text:</span><br>
            <span class="bold">Overwhelming Information:</span><br>
            <span class="bold">Lack of Technical Confidence:</span></p>

            <h3>Problem Statement:</h3><p>Given these pain points, our problem statement became clear: "How can we design a digital learning platform that is both accessible and engaging for elderly users, who often face challenges with complex navigation, small text sizes, information overload, and a lack of confidence in using technology?"</p>

            <h3>Design Process:</h3>
            <img class="site-map" src="../images/Site Map - university for the elderly.png" alt="site map">
            <p>Armed with our problem statement, we proceeded to define the website's sitemap, focusing on simplicity and ease of access. Our sitemap was designed to offer straightforward pathways to essential features. We chose warm colors like soft yellow and green to create a welcoming atmosphere, countering the coldness often associated with technology. The design incorporated large, readable fonts and ensured that the interface was intuitive, with clear, easy navigation to make the digital leap less daunting for our elderly students.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion:</h3><p>The launch of the Senior University website not only improved the digital learning experience for the elderly by making it more accessible and engaging but also served as a testament to the power of empathetic design. This project vividly demonstrated how mindful UX/UI decisions can bridge the digital divide, profoundly impacting users' lives and highlighting the pivotal role of empathy in creating meaningful digital solutions.</p>
